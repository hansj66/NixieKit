# Experimental IN-1 variant of the IN-12 clock.

This is pin compatible with the IN-12 clock and will run the same firmware.

# IMPORTANT NOTE

1. The Board is designed for use with Mill-Max pin sockets (Manufacturer Product Number: 0390-0-15-01-08-27-10-0. DigiKey part number: [ED5034-ND](https://www.digikey.no/en/products/detail/mill-max-manufacturing-corp/0390-0-15-01-08-27-10-0/158196?s=N4IgTCBcDaIAwGYCccC0aCMBWdH0A5UwB2VDNOEAXQF8g))

2. The alignment of the digits with respect to the pinout have been off by a certain degree on almost all of the tubes that I have tested. I would advise against soldering the mill max sockets to the PCB if you have a limited number of tubes available, since the odds are that the aligment of the digits will vary noticeably between digits.

If you care about perfect alignment of the digits and only have a limited number of IN-1 tubes available, a better option might be to use Molex crimp terminals as pin sockets for the tubes (DigiKey part number [WM1103-ND](https://www.digikey.no/en/products/detail/molex/0002091119/26390?s=N4IgTCBcDaIO4FsCMSAMBmAtAOwCYgF0BfIA)) and run wires between the crimp terminals and the board.
